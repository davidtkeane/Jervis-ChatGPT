## Visual Studio Code

If you are learning programming and need a program to help you in everyway, then use this as I made this project with VS-Code with the help of the extensions I installed, the list is below. It makes things easier as you can get the AI to scan you code for erors, bug fixes and more by highlighting the code you want to check right-clicking and select Geni, VS-Code Chat or ChatGPT to fix and solve your problems.

1. ChatGPT - Genie AI
2. GitHub Copilot
3. GitHub Copilot Chat
4. ChatGPT: write and improve code using AI
