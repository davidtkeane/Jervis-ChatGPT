# üìù Jervis-ChatGPT with ElevenLabs and MongoDB

This Python script is for a voice interface chatbot named Jervis. It uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo-instruct model to respond to user input. The user can interact with the chatbot through speech, and the chatbot responds with text and/or speech. The conversation can be saved as an MP3 file and emailed to a specified address. The conversation is also logged to a MongoDB database.

# üßê About:

The script supports two types of voices: the local system's voice and a voice from ElevenLabs. The user can specify the voice, speech rate, and volume through command-line arguments. The script also supports sending the conversation via email and saving the conversation to an MP3 file.

The script uses several libraries, including pyttsx3 for text-to-speech, speech_recognition for speech-to-text, openai for the GPT-3.5-turbo-instruct model, pymongo for MongoDB interaction, and smtplib for sending emails.

The script logs errors and exceptions to a file and also logs the conversation history to a MongoDB database. The MongoDB connection details are fetched from environment variables.

The script also includes a function to send emails with an optional attachment, which can be used to send the conversation history as an MP3 file.

The script starts with a conversation loop where it listens for user input, processes the input, generates a response, and speaks the response. The conversation continues until the user says "goodbye".

## Advanced Summary:

The script continues with MongoDB integration for storing conversation logs, modifying the send_email function to use environment variables for email credentials and to handle attachments. It then enters a conversation loop, using speech recognition to convert user speech to text and processing it. The script handles various commands and exceptions, including a 'goodbye' command to end the conversation. It also includes error handling and logging, with the capability to test error logging by raising an exception.

The script initializes environment variables, sets up logging, and configures a speech engine. It includes an argument parser for command-line options and integrates with OpenAI and ElevenLabs APIs for voice synthesis. The script also contains a function to process user input using GPT, handle voice output (either through ElevenLabs or pyttsx3), and log conversations. Email credentials are retrieved from environment variables, and a function to log conversations and save audio data is defined. The script is prepared to handle text-to-speech, speech recognition, and email functionalities, with provisions for command-line arguments to customize behaviour.
