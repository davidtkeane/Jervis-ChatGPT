# üìù Jervis-ChatGPT with ElevenLabs and MongoDB

This Python script is for a voice interface chatbot named Jervis. It uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo-instruct model to respond to user input. The user can interact with the chatbot through speech, and the chatbot responds with text and/or speech. The conversation can be saved as an MP3 file and emailed to a specified address. The conversation is also logged to a MongoDB database.

The script supports two types of voices: the local system's voice and a voice from ElevenLabs. The user can specify the voice, speech rate, and volume through command-line arguments. The script also supports sending the conversation via email and saving the conversation to an MP3 file.

The script uses several libraries, including pyttsx3 for text-to-speech, speech_recognition for speech-to-text, openai for the GPT-3.5-turbo-instruct model, pymongo for MongoDB interaction, and smtplib for sending emails.

The script logs errors and exceptions to a file and also logs the conversation history to a MongoDB database. The MongoDB connection details are fetched from environment variables.
The script also includes a function to send emails with an optional attachment, which can be used to send the conversation history as an MP3 file.
The script starts with a conversation loop where it listens for user input, processes the input, generates a response, and speaks the response. The conversation continues until the user says "goodbye".
